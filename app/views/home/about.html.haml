%h1 What is PromoteGo.org?
%p
  PromoteGo.org is a new site under development, dedicated to promoting the
  game of
  = link_to "Go", home_path(:page => 'what-is-go'), :title => 'What is Go?'
  in the United States and abroad.  Currently it's the work of one person,
  but I need a lot of help in realizing the vision of PromoteGo.org!  If
  you're interested in helping in any way, email me
  == (#{mail_to "contact@promotego.org", 'click here'}), or you can join our
  = link_to "Google Group", "http://groups.google.com/group/promotego-discuss"
  for discussing the application.
%h2 Get Go games out into the public eye
%p
  First and foremost, it will be a place for people to arrange to
  play a game of Go in person in local public places, such as Parks,
  Libraries, Coffee Houses, and Pubs.  By getting more games in
  public, we can raise awareness.
%p
  On the day that people stop asking us if the game we're playing is
  Othello, we can declare success in this goal.

%h2 Create a viral method of promoting Go
%p
  Second, it can function as a viral method of promoting the game
  of Go: We can provide fliers to promote the site, and have a point
  system for referrals so we can recognize the most active members,
  and maybe give away T-shirts and stuff as incentives.  When people
  see the in-person games, sign up because of a flier, and schedule
  a teaching session through the site, the site will grow.
%p
  In order to meet this goal, we will need to offer teaching sessions
  and teaching games through the site, rather than just one-on-one
  games.

%h2 Provide a better club list
%p
  Third, it can provide a club list to the community.  The current
  site at usgo.org doesn't offer a radial search for people to find
  the nearest club, but only lists all clubs on a state-by-state
  basis.  We can make it easier for people to find the closest club.
%p
  We
  == #{link_to "already have this in place", :controller => :search, :action => :radius}!
  I'll be trying to convince the AGA to link to the promotego.org
  list and use it as the authoritave U.S. list.  Wish me luck!

%h2 Assist in creating new clubs
%p
  Fourth, it can provide a catalyst for creating new clubs.  New club
  proposals will be included in club search results.  When no club
  or proposed club is found in a local club search, a user will be
  able to propose a new club in their area.  Clubs could start out
  as ad-hoc meetings at one of the public location types, and organize
  from there.

%h2 Open Source Software
