%h1 PromoteGo.org search widget

%p
  Now you can include a search widget on your blog or web site to help your customers find a club where they can play Go!
  The widget will render a search box page into your site that looks like this:
%p
  = render :partial => 'search_widget'
%p
  When your users enter their address or zip code information, they'll get a list of all known Go clubs in their area.
%p To include the search box on your site, simply copy and paste the following code into your site layout:
%p{:style => "margin-left: 3em;"}
  %code
    &== <script type="text/javascript" src="http://promotego.org/widgets/search.js" /><noscript>Find a #{link_to 'Go Club', :controller => :search, :action => :radius, :only_path => false} near you!</noscript>
