Must Have:

    Dev Tasks:
        - add to rails statistics: number of duplicate lines ;-)
        - Add an option for separating HTML/CSS related reports, from JS ones and from Ruby ones.
        - Add support for mini-spec, mini-unit, test/spec (what's the new name) expectation frameworks
        - TODO: update README
        - Add plugin version

    Communication Tasks:        
        - Send post to beta testers: Philippe, Paris on Rails, Simon, Bcn on Rails, Raul, Rafa, Christian Rynning, Markus: active rubyforge forum
        - Aptana RadRails report, vim report (ask Marco)?
        - generate this todo from rake todo ;-)
        - write Doc for rubyforge homepage: links to blog post + image +
        - publicize in blogs and plugin sites after feeback from beta testers: make list

Nice to have:
        - use geminstaller to install missing gems
        - run "java -version" to check java is installed
        - set up a configuration file called dry.yml to your config folder for setting up rake tasks
        - move code to a gem so it can be outside of Rails ;-)
        - compile specs and use them for doc (?)
        - Use http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/bones/ for project admin tasks
        - use bones for documentation?

Someday Maybe: 
        - use allison for rdoc (?) Will I write any rdoc?
        - Use Validatable from Jay Fields
        - Ask DHH to record his voice saying: "Don't Repeat Yourself" and play that sound when the project contains some duplicate lines :-)
