Report the duplicate lines in your code, integrated with Textmate and Netbeans.

== Install

Dependencies:
* java executable in the path
* gem install syntax

Install the plugin:
ruby script/plugin install http://dryplugin.rubyforge.org/svn/vendor/plugins/dont_repeat_yourself/

== Description

Watch the 1 min screencast at http://www.21croissants.com/files/dry_screencast.html

There are two ways of using the plugin:
* with a Test Unit framework (Test::Unit & RSpec at the moment), to get a generate a report within your IDE
(Netbeans / Textmate) every time you run the tests
* with rake tasks, if you don't write tests (give it a try!) or you want to generate a report with your Continuous Integration tool.

=== with Test::Unit

class DryTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_should_display_duplicate_lines
    assert_DRY(rails_application.with_netbeans_reporting)
  end
end

=== with RSpec

require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/spec_helper'

describe "Dupplicate lines Report: Don't Repeat Yourself" do
  
  it { rails_application.
      with_threshold_of_duplicate_lines(4).
      with_netbeans_reporting.
        should be_DRY }
end

=== Rake tasks:
rake dry:report:html                 # html, including the snippets of duplicate lines
rake dry:report:netbeans             # Netbeans, displays the report in the Output window and contains some links which open the files
rake dry:report:textmate             # TODO: checks if it works with someone who has a Mac ;-)

rake dry:cruise_control_artefact     # Copy the HTML report to the CruiseControl artefact folder

Current Unit Test (RSpec specs) coverage is 95%. My objective is to get 100% after I receive some 
feedback from the beta testers ;-)
