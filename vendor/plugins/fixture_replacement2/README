== What is FixtureReplacement

FixtureReplacement is a Rails[http://rubyonrails.org/] plugin that provides a simple way to 
quickly populate your test database with model objects without having to manage multiple, 
brittle fixture files. You can easily set up complex object graphs (with models which 
reference other models) and add new objects on the fly.

Not only can FixtureReplacement make your test data easier to maintain, it can also help 
to make your tests and specs much more readable and intention-revealing by allowing you 
to omit extraneous details and focus only on the attributes that are important for a 
particular behaviour. It works well with both RSpec[http://rspec.rubyforge.org/] and 
Test::Unit[http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html].

=== What's new in Version 2:

(Skip this section if you are new to fixture replacement)

The format of the db/example_data.rb file is much more flexible.  Now namespacing
is taken care of, and even custom fixtures can be created.  Here are some examples:

  module FixtureReplacement
  
    # using Namespacing
    attributes_for :credit_card, :class => Payment::CreditCard do |cc|
      cc.user = default_user
      cc.card_number = "5555-5555-5555-5555"
    end
    
    attributes_for :user do |u|
      email = random_email
  
      u.username = random_username                            
      u.password = "my-pass"
      u.password_confirmation = "my-pass"
      u.education_level = default_education_level
      u.gender = "male"
      u.email_address = email
      u.email_address_confirmation = email 
      u.date_of_birth = Time.mktime('1985', '06', '12')
    end
    
    # Here is the custom fixture.  The :from inherits 
    # all the attributes from the user specified above,
    # but specific attributes can be overriden as needed.
    # This is especially helpful in script/console in development
    # mode, when you need to login to your site.
    #
    # This will generate the methods create_scott, and new_scott,
    # which can be passed hashes, as usual
    attributes_for :scott, :from => :user do |u|
      u.username = "scott"
      u.password = "scott"
      u.password_confirmation = "scott"
    end
    
    # And here is an STI example.  Notice the :class needs
    # to be specified, as well as the :from key, which will
    # inherit the attributes.
    
    attributes_for :item do |i|    
      i.user = default_user
      i.category = default_category
      i.title = "Test Title #{String.random}"
      i.description = String.random
      i.text = "Item Text #{String.random}"
    end

    attributes_for :writing, :from => :item, :class => Writing
    
Since all of this is in one file, editing it shouldn't be a big task.  Also,
the create_*, new_* and default_* methods are still in place and function in the same
manner as they did before, so none of your tests should need to change.

Another note: If you are running FixtureReplacement on externals, you'll want to remove
the old repository link (http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement/), and
switch to the new one (http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement2/).

Version 1 still works, and you are welcome to use it, but no new development will occur
with it.  The old docs are still around[http://fixture_replacement.rubyforge.org/version_one/]


== How to use FixtureReplacement

=== Defining default attributes

At the heart of FixtureReplacement is the <tt>db/example_data.rb</tt> file where you 
define the default attributes for each of your test models. This example shows the default
attributes for a user:

  module FixtureReplacement
    
    attributes_for :user do |u|
      password = String.random
    
      u.value                  = "a value",
      u.other                  = "other value",
      u.another                = String.random,     # random string 10 characters long
      u.one_more               = String.random(15), # 15 characters long
      u.password               = password,
      u.password_confirmation  = password,
      u.associated_object      = default_bar        # expects attributes_for :bar to be setup
    end
    
  end

Note that:

- a String.random method is provided for attributes whose exact value isn't important; this means you can 
  create multiple, unique model instances
- you can perform arbitrary set-up and execute any Ruby code prior to returning the hash 
  (as shown here where a <tt>password</tt> is generated and then used for both the <tt>:password</tt> and 
  <tt>:password_confirmation</tt> attributes)
- a <tt>default_modelname</tt> method is automatically provided that allows you to set up dependent 
  model objects (in this case an instance of the <tt>Bar</tt> model)
  
A small generator is included to start setting up the db/example_data.rb file.  Run:

  ./script/generate fixture_replacement

=== Available methods

Based on the above definition FixtureReplacement makes the following methods available:

- String.random: generates a random string as shown above
- <tt>new_user</tt>: equivalent to <tt>User.new</tt> with the attributes for the user.
- <tt>create_user</tt>: equivalent to <tt>User.create!</tt> with the user's attributes.
- <tt>default_user</tt>: for use inside <tt>model_attributes</tt> definitions; this basically 
  returns a <tt>Proc</tt> object which allows the actual creation of the object to be deferred 
  until it is actually needed: in this way unnecessary object creation is avoided until it is 
  known for sure that a particular attribute is not going to be overridden.

=== Overriding attributes

Overrides of specific attributes can be performed as follows:

  new_user(:thing => "overridden") 
  create_user(:thing => "overridden")
  
Overrides can also be used with associations:

  scott = create_user(:username => "scott")
  post = create_post(:user => scott)
  
  
=== attr_protected / attr_accessible

In the case that the model has an attr_protected field, FixtureReplacement
will assign the field as if it wasn't protected, which is convenient for testing:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    attr_protected :admin_status
  end

  user = create_user(:username => "scott", :admin_status => true)
  user.admin_status # => true
  
== Motivation Behind FixtureReplacement

As Dan Manges has outlined in his blog post, "Fixing Fixtures with Factory" (http://www.dcmanges.com/blog/38), 
this approach to generating test data has a number of advantages:

- The factory provides default values and relationships
- Invalid data will never be loaded into your test database, as it is with the typical YAML fixture. 
  A record which is created with a create_* method (create_user, create_post, etc.) uses ActiveRecord's 
  create! behind the scenes, so any invalid data will raise a clear error.  This means that you will 
  spend your time debugging your tests and code, not your test data.
- It's in Ruby, so you won't have to fight with YAML's spacing issues, plus the data is by nature
  more dynamic and more agile.
- When a test fails (and they will), someone who hasn't written the test will be able to figure out
  the *intention* behind the test.  They won't have to go digging through YAML files to figure out
  the relevant data to the test.
- No more opening of 5 different YAML files to see the associations and column names of different models -
  this is conveniently located in one file (db/example_data.rb)
- If you set use_transactional_fixtures = true in your test_helper or spec_helper (and you *really* should
  be using this), the data that is created in each test will be rolled back, meaning no-side effects, 
  and a consistent database among different developers, and for your self during different test runs.
  
  
=== Random Data in db/example_data.rb

The use of random data should also be spoken of.  Many may think this to be dangerous, but in fact random
data is often helpful.  Consider the following snippets of psudo-code (along with it's test):

  # apps/models/user.rb : 
  # ----------------------

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_uniqueness_of :username
    validates_presence_of :password
  
    after_create :check_password
  
  private

    def check_password
      # ...
    end
  
  public
  
    def establish_friendship_with(other_user)
      # ...
    end
  
    def friends
      # ...
    end
  end
  
  
  # The test: 
  # ---------

  def test_make_sure_user_can_establish_friendship
    @user_one = User.create({
      :username => "foo", 
      :password => "some password", 
      :password_confirmation => "some password_confirmation"  
    })
    @user_two = User.create({
      :username => "bar", 
      :password => "some password", 
      :password_confirmation => "some password confirmation"
    })
  
    @user_one.establish_friendship_with(@user_two)
    @user_one.friends.should == [@user_two]
  end

Notice that the above test adds a lot of extra noise in getting valid users into the database; The test, however, doesn't care what the usernames are, that the password is a good one, that the password matches the password confirmation, and so on.  The point of the test is not to check those things, but rather that a friendship can be established.  

Here would be a similar test with the FixtureReplacement:
  
  # The test: 
  # ---------
  
  before :each do 
    @user_one = create_user
    @user_two = create_user
  end

  def test_make_sure_user_can_establish_friendship  
    @user_one.establish_friendship_with(@user_two)
    @user_one.friends.should == [@user_two]
  end

Once again, the test above doesn't care about usernames, so why should you?  But to even store those two users into the database, you will need unique usernames, as well as password which match.  Here is where the random data comes in:

  # db/example_data.rb
  # -------------------
  
  module FixtureReplacement   
    
    attributes_for :user do |u|
      password = String.random
      
      u.username => String.random,
      u.password => password,
      u.password_confirmation => password
    end    
    
  end
  
Now, in a different test case, if you do care about the usernames not being random, it is easy to set them:

  create_user({
    :username => "scott", 
    :password => "foobar", 
    :password_confirmation => "foobar"
  })


     
=== Disadvantages of FixtureReplacement     
     
The one major disadvantage behind this approach is that it's slow - just as slow as fixtures, if not slower.
One approach that the rspec crowd is using is to use this plugin in integration tests, while using mocks & stubs
in model unit tests.  It's not a big deal if your integration tests run slow, since you probably don't run
them very often.

Another approach is to look to external sources to speed up your test suite:

- a sqlite3 in-memory database (can cut your test/spec time in half)
- unit-record gem (by Dan Manges), which takes advantage of multi-core processors
- a distributed build system, such as spec_distributed
- running tests individually, or per file
- A faster machine
  
If you have other ideas for speeding up your test suite, I'm all ears.

== Installation

  ruby script/plugin install http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement2/
  
Or use externals:

  ruby script/plugin install -x http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement2/
  
Run the generator if you don't have the file <tt>db/example_data.rb</tt>:

  ruby script/generate fixture_replacement

=== Using FixtureReplacement within <tt>script/console</tt>

  % script/console
  >> include FixtureReplacement

=== Using it with RSpec

Add the following to your <tt>spec/spec_helper.rb</tt> file, in the configuration section:

Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
  config.include FixtureReplacement
end

=== Using it with Test::Unit

Add the following to your <tt>test/test_helper.rb</tt> file:

class Test::Unit::TestCase

  include FixtureReplacement

end

== Running the Specs/Tests for FixtureReplacement

You will need rspec (version 1.0.8 or later) to run the specs, as well as the sqlite3-ruby gem 
(and sqlite3 installed):

  % sudo gem install rspec
  % sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby

cd into the fixture_replacement plugin directory:
  
  % cd vendor/plugins/fixture_replacement
  
Then run with <tt>rake<tt>

  % rake
  
There are also some tests for test/unit.  These mainly serve as regressions, but you are free
to run them as well.
