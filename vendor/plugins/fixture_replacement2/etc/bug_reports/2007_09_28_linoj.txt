Hi Scott,

I'm wondering if you have insight into this or if I should go ask somewhere else.

I installed 2 plug-in today, 
first fixture_replacement plugin
and been using it successfully

Then I installed validates_email_format_of plugin
http://code.dunae.ca/validates_email_format_of

and added this to my User model
	validates_email_format_of :email

then script/server wont start
When I comment out this line, it's fine

Here's the error:

$ script/server
=> Booting Mongrel (use 'script/server webrick' to force WEBrick)
=> Rails application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000
=> Call with -d to detach
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
** Starting Mongrel listening at 0.0.0.0:3000

I havent tried it in a different project (without fixture_replacement) but looks like yours is getting the blame... :)
